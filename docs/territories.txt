Game Doc explains territories too, but as they are complicated enough to be their own minigame, they are explained in detail here




Gangs
    When the game starts, some gangs are generated
    When new blocks are generated, each of the gangs are inserted into the Block


Gang Object
    Contains a list of CrewMembers or Criminals
    Power level of a gang is measured by taking the sum of every members power level
    
    Gangs have a turn_timer which decrements every turn
        When the turn_timer reaches 0, a new Criminal is spawned
            This does not apply to player owned gangs


Gang Wars
    Every turn, gangs engage in a simplified form of fighting
        Every Gang fights with every other Gang
        Every member of the target gang recieves damage
            damage = power level of gang divided by number of target gang members
    
    At the end of every turn, the Blocks control is determined by the gang with the most members
        The gang that is in control gets the following bonuses
            10 health for each member
            $25
        
        All other gangs recieve 25 health to keep the fighting going

        All Gangs will also use their coffers in a simple procedure to purchase armor




World contains a finite amount of Cities

New Cities can be purchased
    next_city cost = (to be determined)


Cities contain a set-random amount of Blocks


Blocks contain a list of Gangs
    Each Gang is represented in each block with their own Gang object
