This game idea still lacks a few things
    There may not be enough money sinks / Money might not feel valuable
    Currently Player has full control and is never acted on.
        Random challenges to displace the Players progress can add more complexity
    
    Strategy for Saving and Loading progress still neds to be made



Weapons
    name str
    ranged bool determined if weapon is ranged or not
    power int determines weapon damage in indirect way
        damage = power * (user_skill * 0.5)
    durability int
        When durability hits 0, the weapon is removed from Human
        Managed through use method, returns broken bool



Humans
    All pedestrians, Criminals, and Police derive from base Human class
    Humans can hold weapons and fight
        During a fight both humans power level is measured
            floor(weapon.power * (relevant_stat * 0.5))
        Then hit rolls are performed based on Humans shooting/strength stat against the targets dodging stat
            These hit rolls are performed until someone dies
    
    level_up_cost(n):
        8 + (8 * ((level_up_cost(n-1) - level_up_cost(n-2)) / 2))
            n - 1 or 2 should have a min value of 0



Player has Crew of Criminals
    When amount of Criminals hits 0, the player loses and the game is over
    Player has money that they can use to buy armor and weapons for the crew
    Player has a Warehouse to store armor, weapons, and items to sell


World holds components together
    Player who inhabits the World
    Cities list which starts with one City and expands
        City object have a list of Blocks that starts with one Block and expands a finite number of times
            Blocks are areas to control. Neither player nor any crew member have any position in the World. They are omnipresent
            See below for more details about Blocks

    Bank which handles Bank logic
        Savings account
            Deposit any amount whenever
            Can only Withdraw x amount every n number of turns
            Savings per turn averaged out every 30 turns and added to Savings as dividend
        
        Take Loan
            Loan has a cap depending on Players credit score
            Loan has interest every 10 turns
            If Loan reaches a certain percentage of its original value above 100%, bank seizes players assets starting with money and working through Warehouse
                Items sold to Bank under this circumstance sold at horribly cheap rate
    
    list of Properties owned by Player
        Properties perform tasks regularly, but cost money to keep
    
    Global Stats object to keep track of interesting stats during gameplay
        Actually handle this in CrimeGame Class


Warehouse
    Everything that the Player owns that isn't vests or weapons are stored here
    Warehouse has items dict which stores dictionaries of items
        sub dictionaries allow us to seperate items by item quality
    
    When selling items, player enters what minimum quality they want to sell
        If not quality is enetered, sell all items

    Item Qualities              Multiplier
        0 : Busted              0.25
        1 : Very Rough          0.5
        2 : Worn                0.75
        3 : Decent              1
        4 : Fancy               2.5
        5 : Luxery              4.5
        6 : Extremely Rare      7
        7 : Legendary           10
        8 : One of a kind       13.5
    
    Item value multiplier = max(quality - 2, 1) * 0.25 * (quality + 1)


City
    Contains list of Blocks


Blocks
    Blocks have a list containing Gangs
        Gangs contain a list of Criminals
        Gangs go at war with each other every turn
        The Gang with the highest power level controls the Block
            Power Level = sum(health + armor + weapon)
            All Criminals in the Gang that controls the block are healed for 10 health every turn
    
    Player can take over new Blocks by picking a turf strategy
