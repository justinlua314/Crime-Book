Adding Menu option
    CrimeGame object has a menu_manager where all menus are registered
    menu_home in menus.home.py is where the main menu is defined
    Menus branching from the main menu should get their own files
        Example: menus.crime.py




Heists
    Should require more significant man power than petty crimes
    Each Heist gives player unique rewards other than just money or random items
    There's also a unique fail condition for each

    Heist                   Crew Count      Reward              Fail
    Bank                    50              Money + Gold Bars   savings = 0, heat++, give player loan
    Prison                  100             Crew Members        Lose 90% of crew members
    Car Museum              200             Great Cars          All vehicles taken, lots of heat
    Police Station          500             Heat = 0            Heat cap // 2 then heat significantly raised
    Military Base           800             Weapons galore      Same as Police Station but worse
    Nuclear Power Plant     1000            The Nuke            Lose game


    Cannot send more or less crew members, would be too easy
    Grabs best Crew Members for job

    When heist is ran, player watches situation play out

    Crew members face different challenges in a scripted gauntlet

    If all crew members die before gauntlet is over, player loses
